# What is MVC model?

MVC is a software architecture pattern that separates an application into three interconnected components: the Model, the View, and the Controller. This pattern was first introduced in the 1970s for developing desktop graphical user interfaces (GUIs) but has since been adopted in web application development.

In an MVC architecture, the Model represents the application's data and business logic, the View represents the presentation layer or the user interface, and the Controller acts as an intermediary between the Model and the View. The three components work together to provide a clear separation of concerns, making the application easy to maintain and test.

The main goal of MVC is to split large applications into specific sections that have their own individual purpose. It also allows developers to logically structure applications in a secure way.

# Why use MVC in Node.js?

Node.js is a popular platform for building server-side applications due to its event-driven, non-blocking I/O model. It allows developers to write scalable, high-performance applications that can handle a large number of simultaneous requests.

However, as applications grow more complex, it becomes increasingly challenging to maintain code and keep it organized. The MVC architecture pattern provides a clear separation of concerns, making it easier to manage code and enhance the application's functionality over time.

# The Components of MVC

The three interconnected components of MVC are the Model, the View, and the Controller. Let's take a closer look at each of these components.

### Model

The Model is responsible for managing the application's data and business logic. It interacts with the database or any other data source to perform operations such as inserting, updating, deleting, and retrieving data.

### View

The View is responsible for presenting data to the user. It generates the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that make up the user interface. The View can also receive user input and send it to the Controller for processing.

### Controller

The Controller is responsible for receiving requests from the View, processing them, and updating the Model accordingly. It acts as an intermediary between the Model and the View, ensuring that both components remain decoupled.

# Advantages and Disadvantages of MVC Architecture

### Advantages

  -  Faster Development Process
  -  Ability to Provide Multiple Views
  -  Support for Asynchronous Technique
  -  The Modification does not Affect the Entire Model
  -  MVC Model Returns the Data without Formatting
  -  SEO Friendly Development Platform

### Disadvantages

  -  Complexity
  -  Cost of Frequent Updates
  -  Must have Strict Rules Over the Methods
  -  Hard to Understand the MVC Architecture
